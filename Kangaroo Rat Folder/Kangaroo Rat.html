        <h2>About Kangaroo Rats</h2>
        <p>Kangaroo rats, small rodents of genus Dipodomys, are native to western North America. 
          The common name derives from their bipedal form. They hop in a manner similar to the much larger kangaroo, 
          but developed this mode of locomotion independently, like several other clades of rodents 
          (e.g. dipodids and hopping mice).</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Species</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Giant</li>
      <li>Merriam's</li>
      <li>Desert</li>
      <li>Ord's</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kangaroo rats are four-toed heteromyid rodents with big hind legs, small front legs and relatively large heads. 
      Adults typically weigh between 70 and 170 g.[2] The tails of kangaroo rats are longer than both their bodies and their heads. 
      Another notable feature of kangaroo rats are their fur-lined cheek pouches, which are used for storing food. The coloration of 
      kangaroo rats varies from cinnamon buff to dark gray, depending on the species.[3] There is also some variation in length with 
      one of the largest species, the banner-tailed kangaroo rat being six inches in body length and a tail length of eight inches.[3] 
      Sexual dimorphism exists in all species, with males being larger than females.</p>
    <h4>Locomotion</h4>
    <p>Kangaroo rats move bipedally. Kangaroo rats often leap a distance of 6 feet,[4] and reportedly up to 9 feet (2.75 m)[5] at speeds 
      up to almost 10 feet/sec, or 10 km/h (6 mph).[6] They can quickly change direction between jumps.[6] The rapid locomotion of the 
      banner-tailed kangaroo rat may minimize energy cost and predation risk.[7] Its use of a "move-freeze" mode may also make it less 
      conspicuous to nocturnal predators.[7]</p>

    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
      <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
      <p>The brown bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America. 
        Its conservation status is currently <strong>Least Concern</strong>.<br /><br /> 
        There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and 
        the Himalayan brown bear.</p>
      <h3>Species</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Arctos</li>
        <li>Collarus</li>
        <li>Horribilis</li>
        <li>Nelsoni (extinct)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or yellowish. 
        They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown bears are often 30% larger than 
        female brown bears. They can range from 5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe.</p>
